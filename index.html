        <p>Thank you for visiting my digital portfolio. I have spent a lot of time working on this website and I am glad I can finally share it. I want to dedicate my life towards storytelling and making people smile through creative content, and I hope that becomes apparent as you explore this website.
        </p>
        <p>Originally from York, Pennsylvania, I grew up dedicating my life towards public service. Between many late nights spent slaving over my double-majors in urban and environmental studies and preparing to become a public servant, I started to make fun, short videos to let out my creative side. Over time, I realized pursuing my dream of helping people through public servitude was better fulfilled by making people laugh and smile from watching something I made. At first my videos were simple travel vlogs, but after I received compliments I started to shift into scripted storytelling videos about certain life events.
        </p>
        <p>The turning point was when I completed a video about my zealous endeavor to make over 20 quarts of ice cream for friends <a href="https://youtu.be/r7zF-GWHLKI" style=text-decoration:none;color:#222;/ ><i>(link here)</i></a>. The actual ice cream making was a complete mess, and of course hilarity ensued, so I wanted a way to share the ridiculousness of the situation with all my friends. I spent hours editing a video that I almost didn’t even upload—will it be well-received, will people get the humor and emotion I was trying to convey? 
        </p>
        <p>To my pleasant surprise, many of my friends told me how much they laughed or how inspired they felt after watching the video. It got a ton of compliments and one of my friends actually commented, “My heart happy cries!” so I consider it a success. From this experience, I learned I could channel my personality into videos and make someone feel a little bit happier after experiencing something I made. I loved knowing I had such a power. Throughout the rest of my college career, I still stayed true to entertaining people—I had the biggest impact and felt the most fulfilled this way—and want to make video production my new career path.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. (If you are interested and looking for a reason to smile, here is <a href="https://youtu.be/vreMuS8I6lE" style=text-decoration:none;color:#222;/ ><i>a link</i></a> to a video about my mom's proposal.)
