        <p>Hello and welcome to my digital portfolio! I want to dedicate my life towards storytelling and making people laugh through creative video content. My journey to get to this point is unique, so here is my story:
        </p>
        <p>Originally from York, Pennsylvania, I grew up dedicating my life towards public service. Between many late nights spent slaving over my double-majors in urban and environmental studies and preparing to become a public servant, I started to make fun, short videos to let out my creative side. Over time, I realized pursuing my dream of helping people through public servitude was better fulfilled by making people laugh and smile from watching something I made. At first my videos were simple travel vlogs, but after I received compliments I started to shift into scripted storytelling videos about certain life events.
        </p>
        <p>The turning point was when I completed a video about my zealous endeavor to make over 20 quarts of ice cream for friends <a href=https://youtu.be/r7zF-GWHLKI">(link here)</a>. The actual ice cream making was a complete mess, and of course hilarity ensued, so I wanted a way to share the ridiculousness of the situation with all my friends. I spent hours editing a video that I almost didn’t even upload—will it be well-received, will people get the humor and emotion I was trying to convey? 
        </p>
        <p>To my pleasant surprise, many of my friends told me how much they laughed or how inspired they felt after watching the video. It got a ton of compliments and one of my friends actually commented, “My heart happy cries!” so I consider it a success. From this experience, I learned I could channel my personality into videos and make someone feel a little bit happier after experiencing something I made. I loved knowing I had such a power. Throughout the rest of my college career, I still stayed true to entertaining people—I had the biggest impact and felt the most fulfilled this way—and want to make video production my new career path.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. (If you are interested and looking for a reason to smile, here is <a href=https://youtu.be/vreMuS8I6lE">a link</a> to a video about my mom's proposal.) I hope you enjoy exploring the rest of my website, and if you want to reach out, just click on my contact page!
