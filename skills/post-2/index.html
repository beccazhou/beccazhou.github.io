            <tr><td>2/20 10AM</td><td>2/20 6PM</td><td>Figure out how to get the right kind of parallax feature I want (AKA also kinda learn javascript?)</td><td>Frustrating as hell. Slow. It’s hard because “parallax” is kind of an umbrella term, so there are different kinds of parallax templates and instructions. I’m very particular in what I want, which is a background that is static but a title that has a parallax feature. Problem is, everyone wants to teach you how to make a parallax background as well. So it’s a lot of searching, researching, trying, executing, and trying again. I found this <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/">cool website</a>and that’s what I’m trying to emulate right now.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2/22 12PM</td><td>2/22 6PM</td><td>Figure out how to format the homepage the way I like it.</td><td>Okay, I think I’m sort of getting it down. I found this <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/menu/Sticky-One-Page-Scroll-Navigation-jQuery-CSS3.html">sick website</a>and wanted to work off of that. I think it’s frustrating at times because I remind myself that all I really want is just a simplistic, stylish, somewhat minimalistic website. So why is a simplistic website with what should be only a few elements take me so long to get? But also, forcing myself to code on the fly is helping me figure out how to code better. Something interesting, too, is the moment you tell people about coding, they either are a computer science major, or they have a friend who is. So I have a lot of people offering help, and although it makes me feel inadequate I am also SO GRATEFUL for their presence. Like, perfecting the background of the first page was done by my friend Adam. Help is okay, technology is a communal effort.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2/23 6PM</td><td>2/24 12AM</td><td>Adding a video grid layout to the original website.</td><td>Coding is starting to become like coffee (or cocaine). It is unhealthy for you, but highly addicting and you keep coming back to it. And as much as I think “hey, you should be doing other things Becca” all I want to do is finish my code and perfect this GODDAMN WEBSITE. It should be SIMPLE!!! Oh my goodnessssss why is this so HARDDD!!!! My biggest problem is that I created the perfect video grid system in a different .html (based off of <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/layout/Responsive-Filterable-jQuery-Portfolio-Gallery-Plugin-Elastic-Grid.html">this jquery</a>) and assumed (is that where I went wrong?) that if I copy and pasted all my files into the original html, the video grid would perfectly go into my new website. WRONG. I was SO WRONG. It was HARD and I eventually gave up and moved onto something else (I’m predicting it has to do with different javascript codes contradicting each other?). I then made a “contact me” form based off of <a href="https://codepen.io/see8ch/pen/KpLrd">this codepen</a>. It’s frustrating in that I want to make it actually send me mail, but I researched into it and it seems like I need a .php but I have no clue how to do that? Seems like a future-me issue.</td></tr>
