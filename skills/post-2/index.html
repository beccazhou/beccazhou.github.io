            <tr><td>2/20 10AM</td><td>2/20 6PM</td><td>Figure out how to get the right kind of parallax feature I want (AKA also kinda learn javascript?)</td><td>Frustrating as hell. Slow. It’s hard because “parallax” is kind of an umbrella term, so there are different kinds of parallax templates and instructions. I’m very particular in what I want, which is a background that is static but a title that has a parallax feature. Problem is, everyone wants to teach you how to make a parallax background as well. So it’s a lot of searching, researching, trying, executing, and trying again. I found this cool website (https://atmospherejs.com/) and that’s what I’m trying to emulate right now.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2/22 12PM</td><td>2/22 6PM</td><td>Figure out how to format the homepage the way I like it.</td><td>Okay, I think I’m sort of getting it down. I found this sick website (https://www.jqueryscript.net/menu/Sticky-One-Page-Scroll-Navigation-jQuery-CSS3.html) and wanted to work off of that. I think it’s frustrating at times because I remind myself that all I really want is just a simplistic, stylish, somewhat minimalistic website. So why is a simplistic website with what should be only a few elements take me so long to get? But also, forcing myself to code on the fly is helping me figure out how to code better. Something interesting, too, is the moment you tell people about coding, they either are a computer science major, or they have a friend who is. So I have a lot of people offering help, and although it makes me feel inadequate I am also SO GRATEFUL for their presence. Like, perfecting the background of the first page was done by my friend Adam. Help is okay, technology is a communal effort.</td></tr>
