        <h2>Classwork Writing Sample: Envisioning Your Design</h2>
        <p>I love simplistic and minimalistic designs — they are quite aesthetically pleasing and are extremely navigable because of its straightforwardness. I would love to have my final website turn out like that, but I know the simplicity of that website stil has A TON of coding and planning under the hood. But if I could have it my way, I would want my website to have a white+pastel palette, thin fonts, and overall a "clean" feel. (By clean, I mean a design that does not leave you feeling overwhelmed — take that as you will.) But is that engaging and memorable? I think it can be, so long as the minimalistic style encourages visitors to want to explore and click on more links (versus being so underwhelmed that they leave the site entirely). 
        </p>
        <p>I think I will struggle with that, though — the creative ways of being engaging and memorable. I know I would want to use this website later on in the future with my own personal works (specifically writing samples from previous classes and personal video projects), so the context here is definitely a website portfolio to immediately impress (but not overwhelm) prospective employers. Creative enough that it is clearly my own custom website (not some cheap template) and has my own personality integrated into it, and simplistic enough that they don’t have to waste more than 5 minutes trying to navigate it.
