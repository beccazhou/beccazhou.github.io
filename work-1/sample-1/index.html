        <p><strong>Pittsburgh Post Helped Wanted (Oakland)</strong></p>
        <p>Hi. I haven’t done this before. I hope this works.</p>
        <p>So there’s this giant black hole in the middle of my yard. It popped up yesterday. I have no idea what it is. It’s the darkest black I have ever seen. I threw a rock in it and it disappeared. Then I threw my dog in it but also disappeared. It keeps whispering to me “Kill Him.” So yea I guess that’s cool.</p>
        <p>I’m looking for a dude who’s willing to allow me to strap my handmade walkie talkie and jump into the hole—the walkie talkie should work, my dad has it saved from WWII and I refurbished it. I’ve left one in his grave, but he’s still yet to use it, but I still think it works.</p>
        <p>I mean, I guess I can pay you $27.50 but, really, the experience will pay for itself. I just need to know how wide it is and how deep it goes so I know how much cement mix to purchase. Thanks.</p>
