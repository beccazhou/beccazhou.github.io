        <h2>A Choice Related to Genre and Audience</h2>
        <img src="vintage ad.jpg" alt="Vintage Ad" width: 100%; height: auto;>
        <p>I wanted to make an ad in the form of a satirical genre, to make fun of the old sexist ads that propagated the notion that housework is for women. My audience would mainly be women who want to feel a sense of vindication, but also for men who might enjoy the humor as well. If I wanted to choose another genre, I guess perhaps that would be the genre of a PSA. User experience would not change that much as both satirical genres and PSA genres (and advertisements, too) need to use entertainment in order to get the viewer to stay interested in reading the whole blurb. The only thing that would actually change would be the tone of the blurb said. If I were to revise for an expert on this topic, I would probably have more educational things to say, but if I were to review it for someone who knew nothing then I would absolutely destroy patriarchal societal norms with the most savage sentences I can muster.</p>
