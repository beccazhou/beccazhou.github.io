        <h2>Aesthetic Aspects to Enhance the Visual Experience</h2>
        
        <p><img src="Orion Logo.png" alt="Orion Logo">
          
        <p>I chose to update the Orion Pictures film production company's logo. The <a href="http://www.downwithdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/orion-logo-design.png">original logo</a> was really blocky and old fashioned, often the style you see from 90s logos; however, the company reopened in 2013 and the logo STILL used the old blocky font, just decked out. So my main goal was to create a simplistic, clean logo that matches the aesthetic of the modern age. As you can see there is a picture of Orion, and next to him is the company's name in a soft, rounded font with the letters in the same background as the stars in Orion. I think it highlights the name of the company by incorporating its namesake, and I wanted it to be clean because it will appeal better to the new generation. If this design was under different circumstances, I would probably have to make it "busier" because that is against what I was trying to go for anyway.</p>
